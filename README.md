# Vehicle Hierarchy Example
This repository demonstrates a simple JavaScript implementation of a vehicle hierarchy using classes. It includes a superclass Vehicle, a subclass Car, and another subclass ElectricCar. Each class encapsulates properties and behavior specific to vehicles, illustrating concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.

Description
The code defines a hierarchy of vehicles, starting with a generic Vehicle class and extending it with more specialized classes like Car and ElectricCar. Each class has its own set of properties and methods, allowing for the representation of various types of vehicles.

Classes
Vehicle: Represents a basic vehicle with properties such as make, model, and year. It includes methods for driving and printing vehicle details.

Car: Extends Vehicle and adds properties like fuel type. It overrides the drive() method and introduces a method for honking.

ElectricCar: Further extends Car and includes properties specific to electric vehicles, such as range. It overrides the drive() method to reflect the characteristics of electric cars and introduces a method for charging.
